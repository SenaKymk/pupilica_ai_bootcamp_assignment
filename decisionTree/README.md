Project Summary
This project focuses on training and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

âœ… Steps Performed:
Loaded the dataset from Kaggle
Checked and handled missing values
Built and trained a Decision Tree model
Performed Feature Importance analysis
Removed features with zero importance and retrained the model
Compared and analyzed the results
ðŸŽ¯ Model Performance:
Before feature removal:
Train Accuracy: 99.56%
Test Accuracy: 93.85%
After feature removal:
Train Accuracy: 100%
Test Accuracy: 93.85%
ðŸ’¡ Conclusion:
Removing features with zero importance simplified the model without sacrificing performance, making it more interpretable.
